# Autonomous-Balloon-Detecting-Tracking-and-Shooting
This project leverages computer vision technology to autonomously identify and target circular balloons using a laser system. The central computing unit is a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM, tasked with the responsibilities of detection, tracking, and shooting down balloons of various sizes. The aim is to achieve a fully automated system capable of efficiently handling balloons, ranging from the largest to the smallest, without requiring human intervention.
